### Description

This is a project I was working on over a year ago, and never quite got finished. I'm uploading the best version I have, because it's a shame to let the work go to waste. The cars indicate, change lanes and start/stop at the traffic lights. Occasionally they will crash/overlap though, I could never quite fix that problem. I'll be honest, I'm in over my head with it now. Maybe someone else can finish it off. Good luck!
